# Elaine Chew / Decoding the Sensuality in Music

<img src="../../assets/ElaineChew.jpg" align="right">

From uncontrollable guffaws to bittersweet heartache, music evokes sensations that result in pleasurable and memorable experiences. How do performers and composers manipulate musical parameters to pique the senses? What are the tricks of the trade, and can computers help us decode them? We will review a series of papers that take us from the computer visualizations of the humor devices of [PDQ Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._D._Q._Bach) through cathartic tipping points (musical thresholds) to modulating tension profiles that are used to constrain machines to generate music with narrative.
