1
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:14,170
So I've decided to speak about decoding the
sensuality in music, because I work in music

2
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:20,590
information research, and part of the reason
that we spend so much time thinking about

3
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:30,649
music is because it moves people, and it affects
us emotionally, and it's part of the reason

4
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:35,680
why we come and listen to music over and over
again, the same piece of music, being performed

5
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,050
by different people or maybe a same recording
which is the same person playing the same

6
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,890
piece in a particular way.

7
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,850
And part of the reason that I am one of the
lucky people who's able to spend all my time

8
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:57,260
thinking about music and how it affects us
is because of the explosion digital music

9
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:05,420
information, and also because of that, a rise
in music information research, sometimes called

10
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,640
music information retrieval.

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,410
And just to give you a sense of the figures,
the global -- this is from the IFPI Report

12
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:26,280
from this year: The global recorded music
revenue is on the order of 15.7 billion USD.

13
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:33,840
And the share of digital revenues is 50% of
that.

14
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:42,830
And it's growing at a very fast pace and there's
numerous industries that make this possible

15
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,990
on a very large scale, and I've just listed
some of them there.

16
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,700
None of them are funding me.

17
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,700
[laughter]

18
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:56,930
So there's no reason why I'm putting up these
companies rather than others, but these are

19
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:02,920
just representative companies that work in
music, digital music, and you can look at

20
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:10,349
the numbers and see that there's huge numbers
of people interacting with music through these

21
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:14,190
digital interfaces.

22
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:20,689
And for example, shazam, there's been over
30 billion shazams since they started and

23
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:26,319
it's growing by 20 million per day, so people
are shazamming every day.

24
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:35,779
Spotify has over 140 million users every month,
so we're talking about large numbers of people

25
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:43,340
who need to be able to access and care for their digital music collections and

26
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:50,000
therefore we also need to have computer systems that understand how people interact with their music.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,290
How human brains, humans minds, process music and we need to

28
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:02,050
also be able to appreciate how humans experience
music.

29
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,180
And in this case, how they engage with their
music.

30
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:11,599
OK, so with that introduction, I'm going to
move into today's topic, which is to talk

31
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,959
about the experience of music.

32
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,059
And we all know that music moves us, which
is why we listen to music.

33
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:29,689
They evoke strong emotion, such as goose bumps,
laughter and awe, and part of the reason why

34
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:37,720
it -- music does this to us and because it
evokes expectations, so we form expectations

35
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:44,209
and we're listening to music and when these
expectations are fulfilled, we get a rush

36
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:52,379
of adrenaline, or not adrenaline, endorphins
and we feel a sense of reward for -- having

37
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,069
that expectation fulfilled.

38
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:58,590
When that expectation is violated, sometimes
it's funny.

39
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,700
And it causes laughter.

40
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,529
And sometimes it's just strange and new and
interesting.

41
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:13,169
and finally, music causes tension, so that
modulation of expectation, when there's expectation

42
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:18,519
and that expectation is not fulfilled immediately,
there is sort of a delayed resolution, and

43
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:24,620
so we feel tension when we listen to music,
or and that tension modulates over time.

44
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:31,430
And composers and performers make use of this
property of music to create a musical experience

45
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,450
that is moving.

46
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:41,560
So we'll talk about that, and we talk about
how this is done through sort of one, through

47
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,060
the use of prominence, making events more
prominent than others.

48
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,460
The use of contrast, so when things change.

49
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,750
And the use of time and timing, and tension.

50
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,620
So we'll listen to a bit of music that's a
bit different from what you've been listening

51
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,980
to in the break.

52
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:11,120
This is a Grieg song, one of the most popular
pieces written by Grieg, and I'm going to

53
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:21,280
have to step out of this to start the recording
and for those of you who read music, you can

54
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,260
follow along and even if you don't, it's like
a graph so you're able to see when pitches

55
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,410
go up and down, has that started?

56
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,410
Is the sound coming through?

57
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,280
Well, the sound's moving.

58
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,360
Can we try that again?

59
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,860
No, there's no sound coming through.

60
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,380
Thank you.

61
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,640
All right, you know what?

62
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:49,460
I'll play it for you.

63
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:56,150
Aha
[cheers and applause]

64
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,860
All right, I'm reading that screen over there.

65
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:10,440
. Oh, where's my pedal?

66
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:18,370
Someone took it.

67
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:28,600
[laughter]
you know, everything was set up just fine

68
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:34,470
before this session began, and we had to dismantle
it and so when we reconstituted it, some things

69
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,990
didn't get put back.

70
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,990
Ah!

71
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,070
Here it is, OK.

72
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:53,400
So again, Grieg.

73
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:24,000
(Norma has goosebumps)
[laughter]

74
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,680
>> OK, so that --
[applause]

75
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,050
That is how it works.

76
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,470
Thank you.

77
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,180
[applause]

78
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:38,499
So, if there's no sound for my computer, I
would have shown you how a cellist actually

79
00:08:38,499 --> 00:08:46,710
has far more control over a note than I do. Once I play a note that it, I've done my deed and it changed

80
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:52,500
But for a string-player, they can actually
vibrate and make a sound that actually has

81
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:59,050
vibrato, and this is an example with vibrato.

82
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:11,779
And this is with a software called Eva that
we created last year in my lab and Eva takes the sound signal and it uses pre-existing code

83
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:23,309
that turns the sound signal and finds a fundamental frequency of a sound and then it can automatically extract

84
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:31,689
the moments when there's vibrato, using an
FDM technique, filter diagonalization method,

85
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:35,660
which again, was borrowed from another field.

86
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:41,010
And so here, every single vibrato you can
see the pitch is actually modulating very

87
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:46,410
quickly and there's a frequency to how that
pitch is actually modulating and with this

88
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:53,339
kind of modulation, you actually will then
get a very expressive tone in the way that

89
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,339
the music is conveyed.

90
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:57,440
So thats vibrato

91
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:05,879
Can you hear it?

92
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:10,110
Hm. Hm, I do want to play you this, so let's see
if maybe I can I can clip my microphone to my computer.

93
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:27,009
Oh, well, excuse me.

94
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:28,009
Is there a reason why my -- it's not allowing
me to have any sound.

95
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:29,009
>> There we go.

96
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:30,009
Go ahead and try now.

97
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:31,009
Can you hear it?

98
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:32,009
>> OK, for those, did you notice that slide
that Ian just did?

99
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:33,009
OK.

100
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:39,310
So he did, or the eeeeewww, dad, de-dum, and
this is a very different way of playing that

101
00:10:39,310 --> 00:11:02,040
same thing ... ...
(Played with more of an upbeat tempo ...)

102
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:15,389
>> So, um, the top one is how Ian did it and
lower one is how Suzy did it, so we can actually

103
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:22,510
see exactly what they're doing, in that particular
note to make it very expressive at that moment

104
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:26,610
in time.

105
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,129
And we can actually quantify these things.

106
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:31,439
It's one of those things that's highly quantifiable.

107
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:37,389
You can get a slope, you can get a max pitch,
the top pitch, the bottom pitch and the rate

108
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:44,279
at which it's descending and so we have ways
of actually describing exactly whats being

109
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,379
done in performance.

110
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:57,110
So maybe the audio will work now.

111
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:04,040
Let's try that again ...:
So it's not only in western music that this

112
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,040
is done.

113
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,269
This is an example of Chinese music ...
OK?

114
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:20,209
So you can hear the vibrato.

115
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:26,249
So again, if you put that through Eva, that's
what you get, you get to see exactly where

116
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:32,410
there's vibrato and you can isolate the moments
where there's vibrato and examine and analyze

117
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:37,689
every single one of them so if you're interested
in doing that to voice or flute or any other

118
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:43,550
string instruments, you can download the software
and play around with it at this address.

119
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:48,430
OK, so next we look at contrast.

120
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:55,069
That is another way in which we derive interest
or generate interest in music.

121
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:57,029
This is Think of Me.

122
00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:15,899
So let's see ... oh, yes, OK, here we go.

123
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:38,439
... ...
>> Lyrics: Think of me, think of me fondly,

124
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:53,819
when we said goodbye, me,
>> That phrase is repeated.

125
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:55,470
>> Lyrics: Once in a while.

126
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:59,779
>> There's a bit sadder next ...
>> Then again you long to take your heart

127
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:08,290
back and be free.

128
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,290
>> And we're back to happy moment.

129
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,290
>> ...
>> Lyrics: Spare a hope for me ...:

130
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:20,130
>> And the sun comes out.

131
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,779
[laughter]

132
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:28,089
All right.

133
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:30,749
OK.

134
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:32,239
You get the idea.

135
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:38,429
So there are these different moments where
change occurs, and we take note of these moments,

136
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:45,119
and -- well, there's the orange bit, the orange
bit, the blue bit, and the bright yellow bit.

137
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:50,540
Okay, and now we're going to take a look at
how exactly those moments are created.

138
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:58,639
So this is the -- so part of the reason that
this is -- evokes those kinds of feelings

139
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:04,790
when we listen to it, is that the composer
here, Andrew Lloyd Weber is playing around

140
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:12,749
with tonality, so major and minor moods and
where the bright sun comes out that's actually

141
00:15:12,749 --> 00:15:19,959
where he takes a shift and takes everything
out half a step and so that's a very -- it's

142
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:23,620
a kind of a slightly kitschy way of doing
it

143
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,229
[laughter]

144
00:15:25,229 --> 00:15:27,980
>> You'll see this done quite a lot and you
can try it yourself.

145
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,819
It's very easy to do, take everything up half
a step and it just makes it brighter and seems

146
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:36,220
like something really great has happened.

147
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,589
[laughter]

148
00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:44,689
>> So this is -- this is -- well, this is
a technique, you could say, and so we can

149
00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:49,760
try to track exactly what composers are doing
when they play around with these kinds of

150
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:56,519
tonality and tonal patterns, and so over here,
this is a representation of tonality that

151
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:01,449
takes the original sort of -- this is a well
known way of representing pitches that we

152
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:09,730
hear on -- that we see on a key -- on the
keyboard ... (Plays the keyboard)

153
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:14,170
So that's basically of I've just played what
is on a horizontal line.

154
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:21,819
And on the vertical line is: (Plays)
Yeah?

155
00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:26,750
And so you can wrap it up, as you can see,
the things repeat and you can wrap it up to

156
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,429
get the three dimensional structure like this,
a helical model this is called a spiral array.

157
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:37,239
This is what my Ph.D. thesis was on and you
can represent things inside that spiral array

158
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:44,139
that represent tonal elements and this is
how the spiral array works.

159
00:16:44,139 --> 00:17:01,760
Video: Calculates what's the closest chord
and the closest key as music is unfolding

160
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:13,800
so this is Bach's Prelude in C major and I'm
going to play the first chord.

161
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:23,360
So I've played 3 pitches, the C, E, and G
and you see the silver blocks -- you know,

162
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,040
I'm pausing that here, because I have a keyboard
and I have the software.

163
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,960
I will do that for you.

164
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,440
[laughter]

165
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,930
[applause]

166
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:48,380
AUDIENCE: Ooh!
[laughter]

167
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:57,580
>> OK.

168
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:02,940
OK. All right. So ... (Plays)

169
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:08,600
That's the chord of C in the
key of C.

170
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,240
Chord of D minor in the K of C.

171
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,340
G chord in the key of C.

172
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,780
C cord in the key
of C.

173
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:25,140
A minor chord in the key of C.

174
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:32,930
D major.

175
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:33,930
And so on.

176
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:34,930
OK?

177
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:40,870
So this is able to trace exactly what's being
done, and if -- so that was the Prelude, the

178
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:46,380
C-major prelude from the well tempered clavier
from Bach.

179
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:56,370
Now I'm going to do a parody of this by PDQ
bach and this is from the short-tempered

180
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,280
clavier, right?

181
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:05,780
basically it has those chords again.

182
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:30,900
F, ... .. (playing)

183
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:36,540
That's not supposed to
be there.

184
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,740
OK, right. So --
[applause]

185
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:50,950
Thank you. You can see
when PDQ Bach is actually composing like JS

186
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:56,710
Bach, he's doing things that are sort of in
the same key and in the right moment and

187
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:04,640
when he does things unexpected that veer way out, it makes these
big arcs outside of that close-knit circle,

188
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:12,390
that trajectory so we're able to see exactly
when unexpected things happen, and you can

189
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:19,410
also see things like this is again from PDQ
Bach from the same short-tempered clavier.

190
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:23,320
This is based on Beethoven's 5th.

191
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:30,950
So we know how that motif goes, and later
on he's going to when the motif comes back

192
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:37,150
he's going to play it wrong and what he does
is -- ... (Plays)

193
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,948
It's supposed to go ... right?

194
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:42,280
He's going to go (plays.)

195
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:48,330
All right, so and when he does that it's going
to shoot way out there, way up there where

196
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:57,930
it's not supposed to be so I'm going to get
into that and you will see how that happens.

197
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:15,570
(Plays)
So you see that yellow line goes all the way

198
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:21,190
up because it's not in the right key, it's
gone to the wrong region so we're able to

199
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:26,160
track when things are unexpected and when
things are unexpected is really when the interesting

200
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,000
parts of the music takes place.

201
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,960
When people get goosebumps, that's because
there's a change that's kind of -- well, sometimes

202
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,710
expected but sometimes unexpected but it's
not normally there, and so it gives you pleasure

203
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,240
when that happens.

204
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,340
So changes are very important in music.

205
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:57,680
PDQ Bach, I didn't come up with the idea.

206
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:05,000
I was actually inspired by a book by David
Huron called sweet anticipation.

207
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,480
So he writes about how expectations are formed and how music gives us pleasure

208
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,630
This is the score of what the PDQ Bach looks
like.

209
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:20,670
So by having these surprising moments, we
get humorous moments in music and that creates

210
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,700
laughter.

211
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:28,100
So this is where the PDQ Bach was doing funny
things in the Preludes in C.

212
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:34,230
This is another view of the Prelude in C, where it veers down at the end where its doing something unexpected.

213
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:44,580
This is that Beethoven 5th parody, and this
is where it goes instead of going to E flat

214
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:51,130
it goes to E natural, which is not in the
right key and that's another example from

215
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,130
PDQ Bach.

216
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:57,280
OK, so if you're interested in getting your
own version of the software, and playing around

217
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,951
with it you can download it.

218
00:22:58,951 --> 00:23:00,880
It's on the App Store.

219
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:09,480
At the moment it only works on a Mac desktop
or laptop, so if you have one, do feel free

220
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,100
to check it out.

221
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,100
OK.

222
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:18,850
The theory behind it is -- can be found in
chapters in this book, that came out in 2014,

223
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:26,810
on the spiral array model and all the applications.

224
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:29,640
OK.

225
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,470
Ah!

226
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:39,700
So this is just to bring it -- draw it back
to the example at the beginning that I played

227
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,230
for you.

228
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:46,630
That is an example which is normally if it's
played by strings with all the shimmery sounds

229
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:50,780
and all of the vibratos, it's a very moving
piece.

230
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,990
It's one of the most moving pieces of music,
like many pieces that Grieg has written, it

231
00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:04,130
has a very pretty melody and lots of people
listen to it because it has not just the melody,

232
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:11,350
but lots of changes that gives these good
feelings of expectations being violated or

233
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,350
fulfilled.

234
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:16,280
And the kinds of chords that it goes through
are here.

235
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,240
I've just sort of outlined them.

236
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:29,910
This is E major E minor and there's A minor
and G major and G major again, C major, E minor

237
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:34,600
it could be major or minor here, major and
minor and E major

238
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:43,770
And in the interest of time I'm not going
to play you this video or to stop out of this

239
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:49,610
to go into the MuSA.RT app, I could do that
but you know how MuSA.RT works now and you

240
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:54,950
know how it's going to move around in that
place and show you the chords that are happening

241
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:58,270
in the piece at those times.

242
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:06,350
OK, so when we think about -- if we go back
to Think of Me example.

243
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:11,640
This is where a change is taking place. So you can imagine in how one region

244
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:18,010
In the orange bits it's staying in one region
of the Spiral Array Space and in the blue

245
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:22,910
bits it's going to go to another region that's
going to go to relative minor and then it's

246
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:28,090
going to come back to the orange bit and everything
is going to shift up it's a huge change to

247
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:31,330
the half step up where the sun comes up.

248
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:38,360
So if you actually try to measure in the space
how much distance is traversed whenever these

249
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:44,150
-- whenever these movements occur, so how
much distance is traversed when we go from

250
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:49,990
one section or one segment of the piece to
another, you can actually see the amount of

251
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:56,470
change that occurs, and the greatest change
occurs when the orange bit goes to the yellow

252
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,720
bit, so where the sun comes out.

253
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,700
And this is -- you get to see this pattern
no matter what size window you use, this is

254
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,910
one where 248th notes window, there's 16 so
the window gets smaller, but you still see

255
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:14,670
that gigantic peak when that big change occurs.

256
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:19,170
OK, so time.

257
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,170
Time is important.

258
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:27,240
So we notice these moments of contrast and
change, but we're also interested in how we

259
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:34,780
can highlight these changes using time, and
so we take a look at -- I'm going to play

260
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:41,520
you a bit, and I'm going to stop or rather
pause where maybe I shouldn't pause, and just

261
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:47,590
a little bit too long, just to keep you on
your toes, and you're going to see how the

262
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:54,550
use of time actually creates these kinds of
anticipations and moments of suspense.

263
00:26:54,550 --> 00:27:04,110
So this is an excerpt from a trio by Paul
Schoenfield. This is the second movement of his trio and it has a beginning bit by

264
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:13,237
piano ... (plays)

265
00:27:13,237 --> 00:27:26,660
OK, I've waited too long.

266
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,940
I I've lost it.

267
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,940
[laughter]

268
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:33,320
OK, so these moments, I can hold it very long.

269
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:38,180
I can hold it very long, because you know
something else is coming and you want resolution

270
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,640
to that something else.

271
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,740
So let me do that again and I'll actually
resolve it.

272
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:57,840
(Plays)

273
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,760
OK, so much better, yeah?

274
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:10,230
OK, so because the expectation was set up
and it had to resolve, and because that expectation

275
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,090
was set up, you knew something was coming
and you were waiting for it and because you

276
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:18,050
were waiting for it, I knew I could take more
time, right?

277
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:22,680
And when I take more time, there is great
uncertainty -- well, you know what's coming,

278
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,070
so there's no uncertainty about that.

279
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:30,270
But the uncertainty comes in when that's going
to take place, so that's what I'm playing

280
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:35,040
with when I take time.

281
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,790
And we have the same thing here.

282
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:40,701
There's a moment in the piece, the Grieg piece
beings this is the middle of the piece, and

283
00:28:40,701 --> 00:28:44,700
I will stick the microphone here and have
you hear it.

284
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:50,680
This is sung by a soprano, and at the moment
where she's taking more time than necessary,

285
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:55,900
you will see that in the orange bit.

286
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:23,640
(Elaine is snapping her fingers in time.)

287
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:33,780
All right, anyone tried to beat to this?
[laughter]

288
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:38,470
>> Well if you did try to beat to it, you'll
see that the beats are not the same length.

289
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:44,430
They actually vary quite a bit and this is
where we're going to talk about time and when

290
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:49,470
we talk about time, we're going to look at
those lengths of the beats and how they get

291
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:53,200
modulated, stretched or compressed.

292
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,870
So as to modulate your speculations.

293
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,600
And we're going to talk first about tipping
points.

294
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,950
We all know about physical tipping points,
right, when something's sort of at an edge

295
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:09,820
and the center of gravity is at the point
where it's balancing on and if you just tip

296
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,230
it a little bit it's going to just topple
over.

297
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:16,310
So the same thing happens in music.

298
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:19,300
Here's an example of tipping points.

299
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:27,220
This is an -- a quick example of Kreisler
playing his own piece and since I'm not a

300
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:34,100
violinist I'm not going to be able to play
this for you, but I'll just play the recording.

301
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:49,300
(Violin playing, and Elaine is snapping and
tapping with the time.)

302
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:55,970
>> OK, so this is how much he's changing the
lengths of the beats.

303
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:59,670
And this is not at all what is written.

304
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:03,650
What is written would have been a flat line
if it was played exactly how it's written

305
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:06,120
but instead it's played more like this, yeah?

306
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,890
So there's lots of tipping points.

307
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:14,440
He's playing around it this sense of going
up and down and sort of modulating our expectations,

308
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,190
playing around with it.

309
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:24,070
This is another example, it's going to end
up looking kind of like this and so I'm not

310
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,422
going to play from that recording but I'll
play from the analyzed data here.

311
00:31:26,422 --> 00:32:39,440
(Piano playing, and Elaine is snapping fingers
with time)

312
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,040
OK?

313
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,400
So she took a lot of time before that last
bit comes back.

314
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,850
OK.

315
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:51,620
So we can do that again for the bit that I
had played you by Grieg, so what you'd need

316
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:57,890
to do is you need to have software like sonic
visualizer which you can annotate beats on

317
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:03,250
and once you can annotate beats you can extract
the data and plot it and analyze it so this

318
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:11,170
is what it looks like what she's saying.

319
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:22,240
This is Edith Oldrup and this is a visualization
of what she's saying with the data.

320
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:54,960
(Singing)
OK?

321
00:33:54,990 --> 00:34:01,170
So this is exactly what she is singing and
how she's modulating the time and when the

322
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:09,569
time is modulated, what it may evoke in the
listener are feelings of tension, because

323
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:14,330
now we're playing around with expectation.

324
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:19,580
And last year, in a paper we proposed a model
for tonal tension, so as you can see when

325
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:23,580
things were unexpected in that Spiral Array
Space when PDQ Bach was playing around with

326
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:30,940
the expectations, things were going far, far
away and when things go far away, it's actually

327
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:36,550
creating a big space, so if we look at the
diameter of the points that are traced out

328
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:45,870
inside that space, we have a sense of just
how dissonant or unexpected the music is.

329
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:52,510
So the cloud diameter is a measure of one
aspect of tonal tension, which is that dissonance.

330
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:58,551
We can also look at Claude momentum, how much
is shifting around in that space, and that

331
00:34:58,551 --> 00:35:04,370
momentum within that space, if that's just
too high, that can also cause feelings of

332
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:09,240
tension, and tensile strain is when the key,
the tonal center, the center of gravity is

333
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,240
in the region and you stray very far away
from it.

334
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,060
That also causes feelings of tension.

335
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:21,700
So in this here we have the Tristan chord
which is supposed to be a very tense chord

336
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:26,610
and you can see the three measures on the score for this chord, which goes like this ...

337
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:37,520
(Plays)

338
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,130
OK, so this is supposedly where the tension

339
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,869
is highest.

340
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:50,090
(Plays)
Yeah, and it resolves.

341
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,010
Yeah?

342
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:57,691
So we can then go back and do the same thing
to where people chose to take time, and see

343
00:35:57,691 --> 00:36:05,380
how that correlates with the different tension
measures here for the diameter it's the tipping

344
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:13,880
points are happening just before where the
diameter comes to a low, and over here, if

345
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,220
we look at the cloud momentum, the tipping
points are where there's a lot of movement

346
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:24,450
and if we look at here, the tensile strain,
the tipping points occur where, again, there's

347
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,360
a lot of strain.

348
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:31,760
It's veering quite far away from where the
center is, and so a lot more time is taken

349
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,190
for you to actually experience that.

350
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,340
OK.

351
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:43,380
So now that we have a way of quantifying tension,
an application of this is in music generation,

352
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:49,090
so music generation has become very popular
recently because Google has this Magenta project

353
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:54,610
and companies such as Duke Deck are interested
in generating music that are copyright free

354
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:58,080
that you can put on your home videos.

355
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:03,690
There's also interest in music that's generated
automatically that fit different scenarios

356
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:11,490
in computer games, so it actually molds itself
according to how the game is being played.

357
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:18,230
And so part of the problem of music that is
generated by computers is that it often lacks

358
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,350
structure.

359
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:23,790
Not only does it lack structure, it doesn't
know how to transition from one section to

360
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,560
another.

361
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:35,720
And so in an effort to try to generate music
or find a way of creating music that has some

362
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:46,280
form of structure, narrative structure, we
use the tension model to constrain the movements

363
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,430
within tonal space for music that's generated.

364
00:37:49,430 --> 00:38:01,910
We also use an existing program by David Meredith,
SIATECCompres and COSIATEC. To find repeated patterns inside an existing piece of music.

365
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:08,940
It uses existing music as a template and copies
over all of its rhythms and all of its repeated

366
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:16,570
patterns and so here is an example of repeated
patterns found in the PDQ Bach

367
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:28,640
piece so if we start with the patterns that
are found and following the rhythms of the

368
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,590
PDQ Bach piece, you end up getting a piece
that looks like this.

369
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:39,710
If you just randomly populate it with notes
that just fit the repeated patterns and the

370
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:44,510
rhythmic structure, and it doesn't sound very
good.

371
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,860
[laughter]

372
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:49,900
(Plays discordant music.)

373
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:54,480
OK, not only does it sound not good, it's
unplayable.

374
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:04,650
OK, so after you constrain it to fit the tension
profile learned from the PDQ Bach piece, you

375
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:14,710
very quickly get something that's more coherent
... (plays) and to iterate it once more, and

376
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:22,130
you go, let's go a bit closer to that, and
hm.

377
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:33,020
>> OK, so you do want to stop around there,
because if you keep going, you'd end up with

378
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,520
the same piece again and it's not very useful.

379
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,530
So --
[laughter]

380
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:42,380
Right, because there's too many constraints
and if we try to minimize distance to the

381
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,470
-- what you found from the original piece,
you might end up with something too close

382
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,530
to the original piece.

383
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:51,710
So this was done to many other pieces.

384
00:39:51,710 --> 00:40:09,860
Amongst them, this is March in D by JS Bach.

385
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:26,080
(Plays)

386
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,450
OK, but that's the original piece.

387
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:29,830
Untouched.

388
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:36,470
And now I'll play you what MorpheuS, the program,
generated.

389
00:40:36,470 --> 00:41:08,580
(Elaine plays) on keyboard.)

390
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:14,609
OK.

391
00:41:14,609 --> 00:41:15,609
[applause]

392
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:19,340
So if you're interested in seeing more of
MorpheuS pieces, you can go online.

393
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:26,350
MorpheuS has a website and here are some examples
of other music generation systems.

394
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:33,760
And finally, just to recap: We've looked at
how prominence is modulated in music performance,

395
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,260
how composers create contrast.

396
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:45,700
How performers use time to exaggerate these
contrasts or shape your expectations, and

397
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:49,840
finally, how tension can be used in music
generation.

398
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:54,020
And if you're interested in finding out more
about these projects and others, feel free

400
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,880
