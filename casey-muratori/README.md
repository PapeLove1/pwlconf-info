Modern video games rely on a surprisingly broad array of technologies to bring them to life. Many of the cornerstone techniques used today started life as academic research which was then repurposed, extended, refined, and optimized to suit the demanding constraints of real time game engines. For this inaugural Papers We Love conference, I have selected three influential academic papers which were instrumental to technologies I worked on during my twenty years in the game industry. For each paper, I'll tell the story of how it became a part of the development process, what it contributed, where it fell short, and how it attained the final form it took in game engine technology.
