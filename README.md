#### September 15, 2016 - St. Louis, MO

The inaugural Papers We Love Conference (PWLConf) took place this year as part of [Strangeloop's pre-conference lineup](http://www.thestrangeloop.com/preconf.html). Capping three years of Papers We Love meetups across the globe, PWLConf was a culmination of all the hard work our chapter organizers and speakers have been putting in since May 2013. With a diverse set of speakers we were able to bring a vibrant program to attendees, showcasing the wide array of ideas at play in the academic research, engineering and creative communities those speakers represent.

Each talk was recorded and captioned. We've assembled all of the available materials here as an archive. Each speaker has an entry in the repo which contains the abstract for their talk, the video, and slide decks if available.
