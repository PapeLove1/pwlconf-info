# Justine Sherry / Design Philosophy in Networked Systems

<img src="../../assets/JustineSherry.png" align="right">

In this talk, I will present three of the great papers on the philosophy of how one designs networked systems.

There will be no graphs or performance benchmarks! Using the Internet as a reference, we will discuss the careful reasoning behind system design choices and how they effect other computer systems, human users, and even human society.

We will start with some technical themes: How do low-level systems choices impact high-level application capabilities?

We will end with some human themes: How do low-level systems choices reflect moral choices that impact high level societal tussles?
