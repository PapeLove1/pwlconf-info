# Nobuko Yoshida / Multiparty Session Types and their Applications to Concurrent and Distributed Systems

<img src="../../assets/NobukoYoshida.png" align="right">

Nobuko Yoshida's talk will present a summary of recent papers on multiparty session types for verifying distributed, parallel and concurrent programs, illustrating how theoretical work is grounded on collaborations with industry partners. This research led to the development of the protocol description language Scribble and other work such as static deadlock analysis in Go.
